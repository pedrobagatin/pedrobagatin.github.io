## About me

<div style="text-align: justify">I am currently studying cybersecurity by myself in order to achieve Cisco Certified Network Associate. Before that, I spent 3 years and half at Korea Railroad Research Institute and was Robotics and Virtual Engineering graduate student at University of Science and Technology. To achieve degree, wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXqtiZpZhCY">Trams Drivers' Drowsiness Monitoring Systems</a> thesis. Furthermore, published one paper in Korean scientific journal and one in an International Conference both about passenger detection and hands-free payment methods in trams.</div>

## Published papers:
  1. [Support Vector Machine Algorithm in a Bluetooth Low Energy Passenger Detection System](http://www.ieiespc.org/view_acticles/acticles_d.asp?j=48) - IEIE Transactions on Smart Processing and Computing, vol. 8, no. 2, April 2019
  2. [Passenger's location estimation using Kalman filter for Beacon fare collection in a wireless low floor tram](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8330712) - 2018 International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication (ICEIC)
  
## Research Interests:
  Mainly but not exclusively related to the following areas:
  
  1. Cybersecurity for Critical Urban Infrastructure
  2. Computer Vision - Face and Drowsiness detection
  3. Hands-free payment methods using Bluetooth Low Energy
