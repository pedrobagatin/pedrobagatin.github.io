<h2>About me:</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Electronic Engineer with 3+ years of experience, in object-oriented programming, embedded applications for streaming (TV platforms) and RF electronic systems.
<p></p>
International academic background includes a government-funded exchange program (Science Without Borders) at Korea University in 2013, followed by a return to South Korea in 2016 to pursue a Master’s degree in Robotics at UST. During this period, I also gained hands-on experience in the transportation field, particularly with hands-free payment systems, driver-drowsiness detection and autonomous vehicle research at KRRI (Korea Railroad Research Institute).
<p></p>
After completing my Master's, I returned to Brazil and worked at Sidia Institute of Science and Technology in Manaus (2021–2023), focusing on software development. There, I deepened my knowledge of C++ by developing and maintaining embedded TV applications for a major Brazilian streaming platform.
<p></p>
In 2024, I began a graduate program under the CI Inovador initiative, which aims to strengthen Brazil’s workforce in microelectronics. I joined the GICS Lab at UFPR, concentrating on radiofrequency circuits (LNA, PA, VCO) and gaining practical experience with industry-standard tools for RF circuit layout design.
